  summary:
    'One element’s mass spectrum: a bar at each isotope’s mass number (m/z, along the bottom) as tall as its abundance (up the side). The isotopes are an element’s natural ones (source=element) or ones given in isotopes (source=custom).',
  notes: [
    'element is a symbol: H to Xe (but not Tc, which has no natural isotopes), Pt, Au, Hg, Pb or U. Abundances are IUPAC’s representative isotopic compositions (CIAAW 2024, or 2009’s single values where 2024 gives only a range); masses are NIST’s (AME2012).',
    `isotopes is 1 to ${MAX_ISOTOPES} mass-abundance pairs joined by underscores, each mass (1 to ${MAX_MASS}) and % abundance (0 to 100) joined by a hyphen: isotopes=10.013-19.9_11.009-80.1. Each peak sits at its mass rounded to a whole number. Abundances that don’t add up to 100 are averaged as if they did.`,
