  summary:
    'A graph of a substance’s temperature in °C (up the side) as it is heated or cooled steadily, against the time or the heat added or removed (along the bottom). Each phase warms or cools in a sloped segment and each phase change is a flat plateau. The substance is a setup or custom (substance=custom, with mp and bp). Segment lengths are either typed for a schematic curve (source=lengths) or worked out to scale from the substance’s properties (source=properties).',
  notes: [
    'The curve runs from startT to endT and has only the segments those pass through: solid, melting, liquid, boiling and gas when heating, in the opposite order when cooling. A heating curve must end hotter than it starts, a cooling curve colder, and bp must be above mp, or nothing is drawn.',
    'A setup (any substance but custom) brings its own melting and boiling points and properties; mp, bp, cSolid, cLiquid, cGas, fusH, vapH and molarMass are then ignored. The link doesn’t move startT and endT to suit the substance: set them too.',
    'With source=lengths (the default) each segment is as long along the x-axis as solidW, meltW, liquidW, boilW and gasW say, whatever the substance.',
    'With source=properties each sloped segment takes q = m·c·ΔT and each plateau q = n·ΔH, from the substance’s specific heats, enthalpies and molar mass and the sample’s mass, so the curve is to scale. With xQuantity=time the heat is turned into minutes at rate kJ per minute; with xQuantity=heat the x-axis is the heat in kJ.',
    'The defaults are water heated from −20 to 120 °C; to scale, 100 g heated at 10 kJ per minute.',
    'The x-axis title is not changed by the link: with xQuantity=heat also set xTitle, e.g. “Heat added (kJ)”. The axes are not fitted to the curve either: set xTo and the y range so the whole curve is on the grid.',
    'Axis ranges are text holding plain numbers. From xFrom to xTo counting by xStep makes the gridlines, at most 50 blocks per axis.',
