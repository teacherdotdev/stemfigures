  summary:
    'Atoms, ions and molecules drawn as plain discs, either in a fixed square box as a gas, liquid or solid (layout=scattered, from the particles list and state) or packed in a lattice (layout=lattice, from main and second). An optional key beside the box names each kind.',
  notes: [
    `particles is a URL-encoded JSON array of 1 to ${MAX_KINDS} particle kinds, each {"count":0–${MAX_COUNT},"shape":…,"look":LOOK,"outer":LOOK,"name":"…"}. shape is one of ${SHAPE_WORDS}; look is the center (or only) disc and outer every disc around it. A look is ${LOOK}. A missing count is 1, a missing look is medium white with no charge, a missing outer is small white with no charge, and name (up to ${MAX_NAME} characters) is what the key calls the kind. A kind with count 0 appears only in the key. Particles that don’t fit in the box are left out.`,
    'Key names (name, mainName, secondName, atomNames) and keyNote can have subscripts and superscripts: _ before a subscript and ^ before a superscript, with braces around more than one character, so H_2O is H₂O and SO_4^{2-} is SO₄²⁻ (a hyphen in a superscript is drawn as a minus sign).',
    'seed picks the random positions (and, in a lattice, which sites get the second kind); the same seed always gives the same figure.',
    `In a lattice, pattern=pure uses main only; alternate alternates main and second like an ionic solid; substitute swaps secondCount sites for second (room for rows × columns); interstitial puts secondCount second atoms in the gaps between four (room for (rows − 1) × (columns − 1), e.g. ${latticeRoom({ pattern: 'interstitial', rows: 4, columns: 5 })} in a 4 × 5 lattice).`,
    'border applies to the box of particles and latticeBorder to the lattice (none by default).',
    `With keyList=atoms the key lists each different atom or ion in the particle kinds once (a molecule’s center before its outer atoms), instead of each kind whole. Their names are atomNames, a URL-encoded JSON array of up to ${MAX_ATOMS} {"look":LOOK,"name":"…"}, each naming the atom drawn with that look; an atom with no name in it is listed without one.`,
