# A basic Circuit Diagram Generator, and a Circuit Editor for the rest

Circuits are the figure teachers ask for most (43 requests by October 2026). The Circuit Diagram Generator built for ADR 0004 had an outline editor for any series/parallel tree, and it was switched off before launch: a settings column that edits a tree is slow for the common case and still can't draw a bridge, a second loop, or a part in the place the teacher wants. We split the job in two. The generator keeps to the circuits worksheets start with, a cell or battery and 1 to 4 resistors or bulbs, all in series or all in parallel, with an optional switch, an ammeter in the main line and a voltmeter across one part, set in flat settings like every other generator. Anything else is drawn by hand in the **Circuit Editor**, a page modelled on Chemistry's Organic Structure Editor: parts dragged from a tray onto a grid, joined by wires that route themselves at right angles, kept in the browser. The generator's **Edit by hand** button opens its circuit in the editor, so a teacher can start from a generated circuit and add what it can't do.

ADR 0002 turned down a design canvas as the way into the site; this is not that. Each figure still has its generator, and the editor is the one place a teacher draws by hand, for the figure no settings form can cover.

## Considered Options

- **Keep the outline editor in the generator**: covers combination circuits, but most teachers want series or parallel, and the outline was the slowest part of the page to use.
- **Only an editor**: any circuit at all, but every figure is drawn by hand, even the three-resistor loop most questions need.

## Consequences

The generator's settings are flat and live in the page address; it builds the series/parallel tree of ADR 0004 from them and lays it out with the same code, so its figures still never cross wires. The tree code stays because the hand-off draws the editor's circuit from the generator's layout. The editor has no settings in its address and keeps its drawing in localStorage, like the Structure Editor, whose scaffolding (grid, tray, undo, export) is copied into this app rather than shared, so each site stays independent.
