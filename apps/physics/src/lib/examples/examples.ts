// Example figures: real figures from each generator, each with its own page
// (/<generator>/examples/<slug>) and a PNG in static/examples/, so search
// engines can index them as images. Each is the generator's own settings, so
// "Edit this figure" opens exactly the figure shown.
//
// After adding or changing one, redo the pictures with
// scripts/snapshot-examples.mjs (see the app's README). The first example of
// each generator is also its social card (static/og/<generator>.png).

// Captions say only what the figure shows; answer keys come from the
