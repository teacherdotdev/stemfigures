      'The Wave Generator draws a transverse wave, a longitudinal wave, or a longitudinal wave above its matching transverse one. You type the amplitude and the wavelength, or the period for a wave drawn against time, and choose how many cycles to draw, from half a cycle to eight. The transverse wave is the exact sine curve, starting on its rest line and rising; the longitudinal one is a row of vertical lines, bunched at its compressions and spread out at its rarefactions.',
      'Draw it on numbered axes, displacement against distance or against time, so students measure the wavelength, period and amplitude, with gridlines or just tick marks. The axes fit the wave, a whole number of blocks to a wavelength, unless you type your own ranges. Mark the wavelength (or period) and the amplitude with arrows, labeled or left blank, and label a crest, a trough, a compression and a rarefaction, or leave blank lines for students to write them in.',

        a: 'The wavelength is the distance from one crest to the next, or between any two points one whole cycle apart, read off the distance axis. The amplitude is the height of a crest above the rest line, the axis through the middle, not the height from a trough to a crest, which is twice the amplitude. The generator fits the axes so a wavelength is a whole number of blocks.',

        q: 'How do I make a wave for a frequency question?',
        a: 'Draw the transverse wave against time instead of distance. The repeat along the time axis is then the period, T, marked in place of the wavelength, and the frequency is 1/T: a period of 0.5 s is a frequency of 2 Hz. The generator shows the frequency under the period as you type it, and on the example pages’ answer keys.',

      {
        q: 'How does a longitudinal wave line up with a transverse one?',
        a: 'With both drawn, the longitudinal wave’s compressions sit right above the transverse wave’s crests and its rarefactions above the troughs, the way a sound wave lines up with a graph of its pressure. The lines are spaced so the bunching rises and falls smoothly, one compression and one rarefaction per wavelength.',

        a: 'Yes. Untick “Fit to the cycles drawn” or type in the x-axis range, and the wave keeps its cycles from 0 while the axis runs as far as you set. The same goes for the displacement axis. Without axes, the wave is drawn the same size about a dashed rest line.',
